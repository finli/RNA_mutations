## Find the cancer SNPs
We begin with [a paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31410488/) that did a GWAS on cancer patients. 

[This database](http://ibi.hzau.edu.cn/ncRNA-eQTL/cis.php) has SNPs that were found in people with cancer. 

## Find the sequences
We have to get a fasta file with the gene sequence for each SNP. 

## Predict structure
Then we need to predict the secondary structure of the RNA. [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00300) predicts the structure. 

They made an online version for RNA secondary structure prediction: https://proj.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/rnafm/#/
