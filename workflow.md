We begin with [a paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31410488/) that did a GWAS on cancer patients. 

[This database](http://ibi.hzau.edu.cn/ncRNA-eQTL/cis.php) has SNPs that were found in people with cancer. 

We have to get a fasta file with the gene sequence for each SNP. 


Then we need to predict the secondary structure of the RNA.
