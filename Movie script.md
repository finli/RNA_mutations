Narrator (Calm, Engaging tone): 

While cancer research has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA is gaining recognition for its role in gene regulation and tumor progression. Emerging as a promising biomarker, non-coding RNA could play a key role in early cancer detection and treatment, improving diagnostics and therapies as research advances.

Narrator: 
Let’s start with SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms. SNPs are the small variations that make each person unique. It is a single change in the DNA code, where one nucleotide differs from person to person. For example, one person might have a ‘G’ while another person has an ‘A.’

Most SNPs are harmless, but some are linked to diseases like cancer. By studying these SNPs, we can better understand cancer progression and improve treatments. Think of it like a banana: The point of the banana is like tip of the folded RNA.  A small mutation in RNA can disrupt its structure in a way that exposes new vulnerabilities as shown in images A and B, making it a potential drug target. 

[Visual: Animate the RNA structure, where the same mutation at the tip causes the RNA to "unfold" or "break" in a way that reveals a hidden, vulnerable site—something akin to an exposed crack or weak spot in the structure. Then something glues it together again.] 

Narrator: 
To tackle this, we used SNPs linked to cancer survival from a genome study and applied the RNA-FM deep learning model to predict non-coding RNA structure. This helped us identify mutations in cancer-related SNPs and a control group of non-cancerous SNPs.

Narrator: 
Our approach not only highlights mutations but also identifies druggable regions in ncRNA, paving the way for personalized treatments that could transform cancer care.

Narrator: 
Our early analysis has shown some promising results. We tested cancerous and non-cancerous SNPs. We found that there were more cancerous SNPs in the structural regions, indicating that the changes in those regions were more dangerous.

In the future, understanding and targeting ncRNA mutations could lead to personalized treatments for cancers, resulting in better outcomes and more precise care.

Narrator (final thought): 

The future of cancer treatment is unfolding, and it all begins with unraveling the mysteries of ncRNA through the groundbreaking 3D banana solution.
