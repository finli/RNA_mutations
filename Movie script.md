The global cancer burden is expected to continously increase, therefore early detection of cancer is crucial for improving survival rates and minimizing the burden on health care system. 3D banana's proposal: Unlocking the power of non-coding RNA for next generation cancer treatment
by  Andrianic Durgardian, Camille Porter, Nasibeh Muhammadi, Zoe Hu and Ryan Quan, could revolutionize cancer detection and treatment 


Narrator (Calm, Engaging tone): 

While much of cancer research has traditionally focused on protein-coding genes in diagnosis and treatment, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is gaining recognition for its critical role in gene regulation and tumor progression. ncRNAs are emerging as promising biomarkers for early cancer detection and treatment monitoring. As research in this area continues to advance, ncRNAs have the potential to become key components in improving cancer diagnostics and therapies.

Narrator: 

Let’s talk about SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms. These are tiny changes in our DNA, where just one building block (called a nucleotide) is different between people. While most of our DNA is the same, SNPs are the small variations that make each person unique. For example, one person might have a ‘G’ nucleotide at a certain position in their DNA, while another person might have an ‘A’ instead. This small difference could affect how we respond to certain medicines or how likely we are to develop certain diseases

Narrator: 
SNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, are tiny changes in our DNA where just one building block differs between individuals. While most of our DNA is the same, these small variations make us unique. For example, one person might have a ‘G’ instead of an ‘A’ at a specific point in their DNA. Most SNPs are harmless, but some are linked to diseases like cancer, through pathogenic ncRNAs. By studying these SNPs, we can better understand cancer progression and improve treatments.

Narrator: 

To better understand these mutations, we’ve turned to deep learning. We can now assess how SNPs in RNA affect its structure and function. Think of it like a banana: The point of the banana is like tip of the folded RNA.  A small mutation in RNA can disrupt its structure in a way that exposes new vulnerabilities, making it a potential drug target.

[Visual: Animate the RNA structure, where the same mutation at the tip causes the RNA to "unfold" or "break" in a way that reveals a hidden, vulnerable site—something akin to an exposed crack or weak spot in the structure. Then something glues it together again.] 

Narrator: 

To tackle this challenge, we use a pre-trained model called RNA-FM. This model predicts the structure of ncRNA sequences using deep learning algorithms. By analyzing SNPs linked to cancer survival, along with other databases, we identify mutations that impact ncRNA, especially in cancer. For example, in breast cancer, certain SNPs in ncRNA disrupt its structure, damaging tumor-suppressing genes and potentially fueling tumor growth.

Narrator: 

Our approach doesn’t just highlight these mutations—it identifies druggable regions within ncRNA that could serve as new therapeutic targets. By uncovering these structural vulnerabilities, we open the door to personalized treatments that could transform cancer care.

Narrator: 

Our early analysis has shown some promising results. We tested cancerous and non-cancerous SNPs. We found that there were more cancerous SNPs in the structural regions.

In the future, understanding and targeting ncRNA mutations could lead to personalized treatments for cancers like breast cancer, resulting in better outcomes and more precise care.
