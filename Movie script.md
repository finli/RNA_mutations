Narrator (Calm, Engaging tone): 

In the fight against cancer, understanding how genetic mutations impact treatment is crucial. But there’s a hidden frontier in cancer research that’s often overlooked: non-coding RNA, or ncRNA. 

While much attention is given to protein-coding genes, ncRNAs play an equally vital role in gene regulation and suppression, and mutations in these regions could be key to improving cancer treatment. Our solution focuses on unlocking the power of these ncRNA variants to better predict and personalize cancer therapies.

Narrator: 

Let’s start with SNPs—single nucleotide polymorphisms. These are small changes in our DNA, where a single nucleotide—the building block of DNA—varies between individuals. Most of our DNA is identical, but SNPs are the tiny variations that make us unique. \

Narrator: 

Most SNPs are harmless, but some can impact our health—particularly those linked to diseases like cancer called pathogenic ncRNA. By studying SNPs associated with cancer, we can uncover how these genetic variations affect cancer progression for next generation treatment.

Narrator: 

To better understand these mutations, we’ve turned to deep learning. We can now assess how SNPs in RNA affect its structure and function. Think of it like a banana: The point of the banana is like tip of the folded RNA.  A small mutation in RNA can disrupt its structure in a way that exposes new vulnerabilities, making it a potential drug target.

[Visual: Animate the RNA structure, where the same mutation at the tip causes the RNA to "unfold" or "break" in a way that reveals a hidden, vulnerable site—something akin to an exposed crack or weak spot in the structure. Then something glues it together again.] 

Narrator: 

To tackle this challenge, we use a pre-trained model called RNA-FM. This model predicts the structure of ncRNA sequences using deep learning algorithms.

Narrator: 

By analyzing SNPs linked to cancer survival, along with other databases, we identify mutations that impact ncRNA, especially in cancer. For example, in breast cancer, certain SNPs in ncRNA disrupt its structure, damaging tumor-suppressing genes and potentially fueling tumor growth.

Narrator: 

Our approach doesn’t just highlight these mutations—it identifies druggable regions within ncRNA that could serve as new therapeutic targets. By uncovering these structural vulnerabilities, we open the door to personalized treatments that could transform cancer care.

In the future, understanding and targeting ncRNA mutations could guide personalized treatments for breast cancer—and beyond—leading to better outcomes and more precise care.
